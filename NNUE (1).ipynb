    "## NNUE (Efficiently Updatable Neural Network)\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to build and train an NNUE, NNUEs are impletemented in chess engines because of their speed. The idea behind them is that whenever a move is made in an already evaluated position, the position doesn't change that much. Hence the data used to represent it doesn't change much either, which means (depending on the network structure) that some operations inside the neural network made to evaluate the current position are the same as for the previous position. NNUE's take advantage of this fact, by only making the operations that will be different. To do this we must store information of how the NNUE worked on the previous position, we do this by means of an accumulator. \n",
    "\n",
    "My idea is to build and train a neural network with Tensorflow, after training I will get the weights of the NN and create an identical NN without the first layer. The output of the first layer will be substituted with accumulators, these will be shorter (maybe length 16) than the original input. And they will be easily updated and later fed into the new NN.\n"
